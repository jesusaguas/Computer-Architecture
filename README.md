# Computer-Architecture
This repository contains all my work done in the Computer Organization and Architecture area.
Its separated in two different directories:

1. The first directory (AOC I) has some programs written in assembly language (RISC), in the processor ARMv4 

2. The second directory (AOC II) has 2 projects written in VDHL.
The first one consists in a segmented MIPS 32 with jump prediction.
The other one is a cache, both memories can be found inside the directory and explain in detail the projects.
